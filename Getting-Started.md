# Getting Started
 
To get started using Actum's API, you'll want to follow these steps:
 
### Step 1: Register for a Test Account
 
First, you will want to navigate to Actum's [Register for a Test Account](https://www.actumprocessing.com/register-test-account/) page. You will need to enter your First Name, Last Name, Email, Company Name, and Phone Number to sign up. Actum's support team will use this information for verification purposes in order to create your account.

Once your account is created (typically within less than 24 hours on business days), you will receive a welcome email with your new test account credentials. It is recommended that you change your password immediately upon login.
