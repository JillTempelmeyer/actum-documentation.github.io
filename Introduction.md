# Actum Integration Guide

Actum's API allows developers to manage a variety of powerful tasks, such as creating and updating transacions, managing customer and payment data, and query settlement information. It was initially built for merchants that required a high level of customization. The same, customizable architecture now allows simple integration with software partners, as well. Actum uses HTTPS for all transactions to ensure the safety of consumer information.
